# Netflix Clone

A Netflix-style web application built using React and Tailwind CSS.  
This project was created to apply everything I learned after completing multiple mini projects.


---

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase Authentication
- TMDB API
- React Router

---

## Features

- Netflix-style UI
- User login and signup using Firebase
- Movie data fetched from TMDB API
- Client-side routing with React Router
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

---

## Problems Faced & Learnings

- Forgot to add dependency in `useEffect`, which caused bugs  
- TMDB API was not working on Jio network because access was blocked  
- Faced many challenges while setting up Firebase authentication  
- Margin and padding were not working because styles in `index.css` conflicted with Tailwind classes  
- Learned how to debug real-world issues instead of just writing code

---

## Learning Outcome

This was my first project where I tried to use  everything I learned in a single project.  
It helped me understand React, API integration, Firebase authentication, and Tailwind CSS better.
